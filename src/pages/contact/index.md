      Lindsay has been involved in some sort of strength & conditioning his
      entire life. He is the founder and head trainer of CrossFit The Club. His

      Michael found CrossFit while looking for a change in his lifestyle. Not
      only did he find what he was looking for, but he fell in love with it. His
      dedication and hard work has more than paid off! He constantly trains and
      strives to break personal records on a daily basis by utilizing his
      Crossfit level 1 & 2 certifications as well as his Crossfit weightlifting
      certification. His love of the CrossFit community keeps him continually
      working to help others achieve their goals to become stronger, faster, and
      healthier.
